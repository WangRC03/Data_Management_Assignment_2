## Project Overview

- The analysis uses flight data from the year 2004.
- The dataset covers various airlines,airports,flight routes,and cancellation reasons.
- The project examines how delays and cancellations change by time of day,day of week,month,season,route,and carrier.
- It identifies major factors that contribute to delays and cancellations.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration:** Summarizes the main features of the dataset.
- **Delay Patterns:** Analyzes average departure delays by time of day,day of week,month,and season.
- **Delay Factors:** Investigates the leading causes of flight delays using detailed delay categories.
- **Cancellation Analysis:** Explores cancellation reasons,airline-specific trends,and airport impacts.
- **Problematic Routes:** Identifies the most delayed and cancelled routes,and explores the main causes for each.
- **Visualization:** Includes clear bar charts,pie charts,and line plots to present findings.

## Tools & Libraries

This project uses the following main tools and libraries:

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Seaborn**: For advanced data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the analysis
- **SQLite3**: For SQL queries on large datasets

## Main Insights

- Delays are more likely in the evening and during winter or peak travel seasons.
- Mondays and major holidays often see more delays and cancellations.
- Most delays are due to late aircraft,carrier-related issues,or airspace congestion.
- Weather and security cause fewer disruptions overall,but can have major local impacts.
- Certain routes and airlines experience much higher delay and cancellation rates than others.

## Recommendations

- Airlines should focus resources on high-risk routes and times.
- Extra buffer time in scheduling and better coordination can help reduce delays.
- Improved communication with passengers can reduce frustration during disruptions.
- Airports and airlines should prepare for seasonal peaks with flexible staffing and clear contingency plans.
